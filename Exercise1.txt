User Story:

    - As an authenticated user I want to be able to change my password so that I can change my password for security purposes.


Assumptions:

    - The user is already logged in.


Requirements:


1) Password Minimum Requirements Tooltip:
    When the user hovers over an information icon next to the password input field, display a tooltip showing the minimum password requirements.

2) Toggle Password Visibility:
    When the user clicks an eye icon next to the password input field, toggle the visibility of the password input content along with the icon.

3) Disable Submit Button:
    The "Submit" button must remain disabled until all input fields are valid, including meeting the minimum password requirements.

4) Password Change Request:
    When the user clicks the "Submit" button (if enabled), send a request to the server to change the password.

5) Failed password change:
    Upon successful password change, redirect the user to the home page.

6) Failed password change:
    If the password change request fails, display an error message using the toast/snack bar component.


Errors:

1) If non-authenticated users attempt to access this page, automatically redirect them to the login page.

2) If the user focus on an input, then unfocus, and the value is incorrect, implement the following:
    - Highlight the invalid input with a red border.
    - Display an error message indicating the specific error.
